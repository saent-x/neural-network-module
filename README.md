# Neural Network Implementation in Go

This repository contains a Go (Golang) implementation of a neural network, inspired by the concepts in the book *Neural Networks from Scratch in Python* by Sentdex. The goal is to translate these ideas into Go, focusing on a simple yet functional neural network designed to identify patterns in the CAN dataset.
